Installing Arches Dependencies on Windows
=========================================

This chapter describes what software you'll need to run Arches and
where you can find find it.

Of course, you may use the same instructions to install Arches on either

    **Python Versions**

    While you should be able to install versions of Python later then **2.7.6**, we've had users say that they've had
    trouble with 2.7.7 and 2.7.8
    If you want a guaranteed good result stick with version **2.7.6**
