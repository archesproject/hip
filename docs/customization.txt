Customization
#############

There are lots of ways that you can customize your Arches-HIP application to best suit your needs.  Most of these will require comfort with modifying Python, HTML, CSS and/or Javascript files but are designed to be simple changes that can be easily applied without diving deep into the Arches or Arches-HIP code.

.. note:: In a production environment (using Apache), you will generally need to run collectstatic and restart Apache to apply these changes.  No action should be required when using the development server (Django).
